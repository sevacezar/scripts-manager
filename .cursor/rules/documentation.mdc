# Documentation Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Documentation Purpose
- Help users understand how to use the software
- Enable developers to maintain and extend the code
- Capture design decisions and architectural context
- Provide operational knowledge for support staff

### Documentation as Code
- Store documentation with code in version control
- Review documentation changes alongside code changes
- Keep documentation up-to-date with every code change

### Audience Awareness
- Write for the specific audience (users, developers, ops)
- Consider the technical level of the audience

### Code Comments
- Comment why, not what (code should be self-documenting)
- Document non-obvious design decisions
- Explain complex algorithms and business rules
- Document temporary solutions and technical debt
- All comments must be writted in English even if user is using another language

## API Documentation

### API Reference
- Document all public endpoints
- Include request and response formats
- Document error responses and codes
- Describe authentication and authorization requirements

### Examples and Tutorials
- Provide code examples for common use cases
- Include step-by-step tutorials for complex workflows
- Document integration patterns
- Show complete, working examples

### Versioning
- Document API versioning strategy
- Clearly mark deprecated features
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Document API lifecycle (beta, stable, deprecated)

## System Documentation

### Architecture Documentation
- Document system components and their relationships
- Include architecture diagrams (C4 model recommended)
- Describe data flows and state transitions
- Document integration points with external systems

### Operational Documentation
- Include deployment instructions
- Document configuration options
- Provide troubleshooting guides
- Include runbooks for common operational tasks

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Document what is being monitored
- Describe alert thresholds and severity levels
- Include incident response procedures
- Document logging and observability practices

## Documentation Maintenance

### Keeping Documentation Current
- Update documentation with every code change
- Regularly review documentation for accuracy
- Remove outdated documentation
- Mark documentation with last-reviewed dates

### Documentation Reviews
- Include documentation in code reviews
- Verify technical accuracy
- Check readability and clarity
- Ensure completeness for the target audience

### Documentation Testing
- Test code examples to ensure they work
- Verify links are not broken
- Test installation and configuration instructions
- Check documentation renders correctly in all formats

## Documentation Format and Structure

### Consistent Style
- Follow a style guide for technical writing
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use templates for common documentation types
