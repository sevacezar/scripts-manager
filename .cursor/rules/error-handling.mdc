# Error Handling Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Fail Fast and Explicitly
- Detect errors at their source rather than allowing them to propagate
- Make failure conditions explicit and visible
- Return early when validation fails

### Error Messages
- Error messages should be clear, specific, and actionable
- Include relevant context (what operation was being performed)
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- Consider internationalization needs for user-facing errors

### Use Appropriate Error Mechanisms
- Distinguish between expected and unexpected errors
- Use language-specific error handling mechanisms appropriately
- In typed languages, prefer typed/structured errors over strings

## Exception Handling

### When to Use Exceptions
- Use exceptions for exceptional conditions, not for control flow
- Don't use exceptions for expected situations (e.g., validation failures)
- Reserve exceptions for truly unexpected conditions

### Exception Handling Practices
- Catch specific exceptions, not broad exception types
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level of abstraction
- Don't catch exceptions you can't properly handle
- Never swallow exceptions without logging or handling

### Try-Catch Blocks
- Keep try blocks as small as possible
- Don't mix business logic with error handling logic
- Ensure resources are properly released in finally blocks or equivalent

## Error Recovery

### Graceful Degradation
- Design systems to partially function when components fail
- Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Consider circuit breakers for external dependencies

### Retry Mechanisms
- Implement exponential backoff for retrying operations
- Set appropriate timeout and retry limits
- Only retry operations that are idempotent or can be safely repeated

## Error Logging

### What to Log
- Log the complete error context (stack trace, inputs, state)
- Include correlation IDs for tracing requests through the system
- Log at appropriate severity levels (error vs warning vs info)

### Structured Logging
- Use structured logging formats (JSON, etc.)
- Include machine-readable error codes
- Log in a format that can be easily queried and analyzed

## Error Prevention

### Defensive Programming
- Validate all inputs at system boundaries
- Check preconditions before performing operations
- Use assertions for invariants and impossible conditions

### Null Safety
- Use language features to prevent null reference errors
- Consider using the Null Object pattern where appropriate
- Be explicit about nullability in APIs

## User Experience

### User-Facing Errors
- Provide friendly error messages for end users
- Offer suggestions for how to resolve the issue
- Include support information for unresolvable errors

### API Error Responses
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for API errors
- Include machine-readable error codes and human-readable messages
- Document error responses as part of API documentation
